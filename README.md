# NLP-Based Mental Health Assessment: A NLP-Driven Approach


In today's digital age, social media and messaging platforms like Telegram have become a crucial part of our daily lives. However, these platforms can also be a valuable source of information when it comes to identifying individuals who may be at risk for mental health disorders like depression and eating disorders. This project aims to leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify such individuals by analyzing their language use patterns on Telegram.

The project involves collecting and processing a user's message history on Telegram and then applying NLP techniques to detect signs of depression and eating disorders. NLP is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that deals with processing, analyzing, and understanding human language. It has various applications in different fields, including the healthcare industry, where it is used to extract valuable information from medical records, social media posts, and other sources of data. 

To detect mental health disorders like depression and eating disorders, this project focuses on identifying specific linguistic features that may indicate the presence of these conditions. For instance, research has shown that individuals with depression tend to use more negative language, talk less about social interaction, and use more first-person pronouns like "I" and "me"  [(Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228620644_The_Psychological_Meaning_of_Words_LIWC_and_Computerized_Text_Analysis_Methods). Similarly, individuals with eating disorders tend to use more words related to body image, weight, and food [(Moessner et al., 2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29746710/). To achieve this, we will leverage the HuggingFace library, which provides state-of-the-art tools and models for natural language processing. We will use the library's pre-trained language models and fine-tune them on our dataset to improve their accuracy in identifying individuals at risk. 

The goal of this project is to not only detect the presence of these disorders but also to understand the individual's attitude towards them. This is achieved by analyzing their language use patterns and identifying whether they are for or against the disorder. For example, someone who intends to leave the disorder may use more negative language, whereas someone who intends to continue the disorder may use more positive language. By leveraging the power of language analysis and machine learning, we can help identify individuals who may be at risk for depression and eating disorders and provide early interventions that can potentially save lives.
